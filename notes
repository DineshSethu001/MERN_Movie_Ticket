*>npm i react-router-dom lucide-react react-hot-toast react-player

You're running this command in your React project:

```bash
npm i lucide-react react-hot-toast react-player
```

Let’s break it down **line by line** — spoon-fed style 🍴

---

## 🧩 What this command does:

* `npm i` is short for `npm install`
* It installs one or more **npm packages (libraries)** into your React app.
* Here you're installing **3 libraries**:

  * `lucide-react`
  * `react-hot-toast`
  * `react-player`

---

## 📦 1. `lucide-react`

**Purpose**: Adds **beautiful icons** to your app (like buttons, navbars, cards).

🔍 Based on Lucide — an open-source fork of Feather icons.

✅ Example usage:

```jsx
import { Home, Search } from 'lucide-react';

<Home size={24} color="blue" />
```

> 🧠 Great alternative to FontAwesome or Heroicons.

---

## 🔔 2. `react-hot-toast`

**Purpose**: Adds **popup toast notifications** (like success, error, warning) to your UI.

✅ Example use:

```jsx
import { toast } from 'react-hot-toast';

toast.success('Note added!');
```

You also need to include the toaster component once:

```jsx
import { Toaster } from 'react-hot-toast';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Toaster />
      {/* rest of your app */}
    </>
  );
}
```

> 🔥 It’s super customizable and clean-looking. Commonly used for alerts after user actions.

---

## 🎥 3. `react-player`

**Purpose**: Easily **embed and control videos** in your app — from YouTube, Vimeo, MP4s, and more.

✅ Example:

```jsx
import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

<ReactPlayer url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ' controls />
```

> 🎯 You can set autoplay, loop, volume, and responsive sizing.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Package           | Used For       | Example                     |
| ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| `lucide-react`    | Icons          | `<Home />`, `<User />`      |
| `react-hot-toast` | Notifications  | `toast.success('Saved!')`   |
| `react-player`    | Playing videos | `<ReactPlayer url='...' />` |

---

## 📌 When to use all three?

If you're building a modern React UI like:

* A **dashboard** (icons + notifications)
* A **course player** (videos + toasts)
* A **media blog or note app** (icons + video + alerts)

      -     -     -     x     -     -     -


*>useLocation() in react-router-dom:-
 

      =>✅ It’s a **React hook** from `react-router-dom` that gives you access to the **current URL information** (location object).


## 🧠 Purpose of `useLocation`

You use it to:

* Get the **current URL path** (`pathname`)
* Access **query parameters**, `state`, `search`, and `hash`
* Dynamically render content based on the current location

---

## 📦 Example: Basic Usage

```jsx
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

function ShowLocation() {
  const location = useLocation();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>📍 Current Path: {location.pathname}</p>
      <p>🔍 Query Params: {location.search}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## 🔍 What’s inside `location`?

```js
{
  pathname: "/movies/123",       // current URL path
  search: "?q=batman",           // query string (after `?`)
  hash: "#section1",             // hash (after `#`)
  state: { from: "/home" },      // custom data passed via <Link>
  key: "ac3df4"                  // unique location key
}
```

---

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case                           | How `useLocation` Helps                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 🧠 Keep track of user's navigation | Read `location.pathname`                   |
| 🔍 Filter/search pages             | Read `location.search` (`?filter=popular`) |
| ↪ Back navigation with `state`     | Get `location.state.from`                  |
| 🔧 Conditional rendering           | Change UI based on path or search params   |

---

## 🛠 Example with `state` in `<Link>`

```jsx
<Link to="/movie/123" state={{ from: "/home" }}>Go to Movie</Link>
```

```jsx
// In MovieDetails.jsx
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

const location = useLocation();
console.log(location.state.from); // "/home"
```

---

## 🧪 Tip:

* `useLocation()` updates automatically when the URL changes
* Great for components **outside the route tree** that still need to know the URL
